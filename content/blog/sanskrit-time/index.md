My mother made me recite the lunar months in the year everyday along with some simple shlokas and multiplication tables, until I was about seven years old. That was when I threw tantrums and stopped learning further :sob: So, let's re-learn them now, shall we?

```
Chaitra (चैत्र)
Vaishākh (वैशाख)
Jyaishtha (ज्येष्ठ)
Āshādha (आषाढ)
Shrāvana (श्रावण)
Bhaadra or, Bhādrapad (भाद्रपद)
Āshwin (आश्विन)
Kārtik (कार्तिक)
Mārgashīrsha (मार्गशीर्ष)
Paush (पौष)
Māgh (माघ)
Phālgun(फाल्गुन)
```

As usual, let us use the resources available online such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHOmp8BJKho) or [this](https://openpathshala.com/learn-sanskrit/time-in-sanskrit) and come back here to practice. I encourage to practice numbers from [here](/sanskrit-numbers) first.

Notes:
- hour ~ वादनम्
- day ~ वासरः

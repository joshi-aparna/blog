No matter how well the author had expressed his experiences in Auschwitz, I did not expect to fully understand it for I am a summer child (please excuse my GOT reference). But I did manage to find some interesting thoughts and I would like to save them for a rainy day.</p>\n<p>If I had to tell you in one line what this book is about, it would be this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">You live to serve your purpose. If you do not know your purpose, then your mission is to find it.</code></pre></div>\n<p>The most important lesson for me has been that we can not control what happens to us, we can only respond to it as our best self. Also, do not chase success or happiness. They will only run away further. Success and happiness are always a by-product of what you do.</p>\n<p>I have noted here some of the quotes that had an impact on me. I realise you might need some context to some of these sentences. I encourage you to read this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.in/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl/dp/1846041244/\">book</a>. You will find many more gems for yourself.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Man's Search for Meaning","date":"2021, Aug 05","tags":["viktor frankl","review","book","non-fiction"],"memorydata":{"internal":{"content":"[\n    \"Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you\",\n    \"Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself\",\n    \"Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved. It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, his inner self. Whether or not he is actually present, whether or not he is still alive at all, ceases somehow to be of importance.\",\n    \"But he may be even more astonished to hear that one could find a sense of humor there(Auschwitz) as well;\",\n    \"If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little.

Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.\",\n    \"Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.\",\n    \"The prisoner(read - person) who had lost faith in the future—his future—was doomed.\",\n    \"The sudden loss of hope and courage can have a deadly effect. The ultimate cause of my friend’s death was that the expected liberation did not come and he was severely disappointed\",\n    \"He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how\",\n    \"We had literally lost the ability to feel pleased and had to relearn it slowly.\",\n    \"Psychologically, what was happening to the liberated prisoners could be called “depersonalization.” Everything appeared unreal, unlikely, as in a dream.\",\n    \"Woe to him who found that the person whose memory alone had given him courage in camp did not exist any more!\",\n    \"Not every conflict is necessarily neurotic; some amount of conflict is normal and healthy.\",\n    \"What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.\",\n    \"In actual fact, boredom is now causing, and certainly bringing to psychiatrists, more problems to solve than distress.\",\n    \"If you are suffering from insomnia, the solution might be - not to try to sleep but rather to try to do just the opposite, that is, to stay awake as long as possible.\"\n]"}},"practicedata":null,"img":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/blog/static/4ed19f39884f266835450892c71a67d0/4953b/mans_search_title.jpg","srcSet":"/blog/static/4ed19f39884f266835450892c71a67d0/acf9c/mans_search_title.jpg 750w,\n/blog/static/4ed19f39884f266835450892c71a67d0/8604d/mans_search_title.jpg 1080w,\n/blog/static/4ed19f39884f266835450892c71a67d0/07b0f/mans_search_title.jpg 1366w,\n/blog/static/4ed19f39884f266835450892c71a67d0/4953b/mans_search_title.jpg 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/blog/static/4ed19f39884f266835450892c71a67d0/16935/mans_search_title.avif 750w,\n/blog/static/4ed19f39884f266835450892c71a67d0/5fa18/mans_search_title.avif 1080w,\n/blog/static/4ed19f39884f266835450892c71a67d0/0729b/mans_search_title.avif 1366w,\n/blog/static/4ed19f39884f266835450892c71a67d0/d0afb/mans_search_title.avif 1920w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"100vw"},{"srcSet":"/blog/static/4ed19f39884f266835450892c71a67d0/b1c06/mans_search_title.webp 750w,\n/blog/static/4ed19f39884f266835450892c71a67d0/ce61b/mans_search_title.webp 1080w,\n/blog/static/4ed19f39884f266835450892c71a67d0/704e9/mans_search_title.webp 1366w,\n/blog/static/4ed19f39884f266835450892c71a67d0/8fecf/mans_search_title.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5166666666666666}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/man_seach_for_meaning/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/sanskrit-numbers/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What's your number?
